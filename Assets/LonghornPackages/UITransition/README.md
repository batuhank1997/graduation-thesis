##UI TRANSITION

This package provides basic presets and parameters for simple UI transition animations.

###TRANSITION TYPES

- **Scale:** Scale the panel up or down to zero with a small bump animation.
- **Fade:** Fade the alpha of the objects under the panel to slowly fade the UI in or out.
- **Slide:** Slide the panel from/to a chosen side to open and close the panel.

You can set different transition animations for transitioning on and off. To turn the UI on, use `TurnOnTransition()` and to turn it off, use `TurnOffTransition()` methods.
